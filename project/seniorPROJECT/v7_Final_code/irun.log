		Caching library 'worklib' ....... Done
	Elaborating the design hierarchy:
	Top level design units:
		r_package
		$unit_0x07b9db4f
		tb_ram_controller
ncelab: *W,DSEMEL: This SystemVerilog design will be simulated as per IEEE 1800-2009 SystemVerilog simulation semantics. Use -disable_sem2009 option for turning off SV 2009 simulation semantics.

	Extracting FSMs for coverage:
		worklib.ram_controller
		worklib.ram_env
		worklib.tb_ram_controller
	Total FSMs extracted = 0
					  	next_bank = {rintf.bank_grp,rintf.bank_no};
					  	            |
ncelab: *W,ENUMERR (./ram_controller.sv,100|20): This assignment is a violation of SystemVerilog strong typing rules for enumeration datatypes.
	Building instance overlay tables: .................... Done
	Enabling instrumentation for coverage types: block expression FSM toggle functional
ncelab: *W,COVDCL: By default expression coverage is scored only for Verilog logical operators (|| and &&) and VHDL logical operators (OR, AND, NOR, and NAND), and is scored only in condition expressions. To score coverage for other operators and for expressions in other statements, use the "set_expr_coverable_operators" and "set_expr_coverable_statements" coverage configuration file commands with suitable options at elaboration.

ncelab: *W,COVMDD (./ram_controller.sv,22|19): Toggle coverage for bit, logic, reg, wire, and struct multi-dimensional static arrays and vectors is not supported by default. To enable toggle coverage on for these types specify 'set_toggle_scoring -sv_mda [<max_bit_base2_exponent>] [-sv_mda_of_struct]' ccf command in the coverage configuration file.
ncelab: *W,COVNOEN: By default, toggle coverage is not supported for systemverilog enumerated nets and variables. To enable toggle coverage of these objects, specify the 'set_toggle_scoring -sv_enum' command in the coverage configuration file.
	Building instance specific data structures.
ncelab: *W,CGPIDF: Covergroup "per_instance" option , by default, is set as 0.
ncelab: *N,COVCGN: Coverage configuration file command "set_covergroup -new_instance_reporting" can be specified to improve the scoping and naming of covergroup instances. It may be noted that subsequent merging of a coverage database saved with this command and a coverage database saved without this command is not allowed.
