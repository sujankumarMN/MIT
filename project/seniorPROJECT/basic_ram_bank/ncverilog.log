		Caching library 'worklib' ....... Done
	Elaborating the design hierarchy:
ncelab: *W,DSEMEL: This SystemVerilog design will be simulated as per IEEE 1800-2009 SystemVerilog simulation semantics. Use -disable_sem2009 option for turning off SV 2009 simulation semantics.

	Extracting FSMs for coverage:
		worklib.basic_ram
		worklib.basic_ram_tb
	Total FSMs extracted = 0
	Building instance overlay tables: .................... Done
	Enabling instrumentation for coverage types: block expression FSM toggle functional
ncelab: *W,COVDCL: By default expression coverage is scored only for Verilog logical operators (|| and &&) and VHDL logical operators (OR, AND, NOR, and NAND), and is scored only in condition expressions. To score coverage for other operators and for expressions in other statements, use the "set_expr_coverable_operators" and "set_expr_coverable_statements" coverage configuration file commands with suitable options at elaboration.
	Generating native compiled code:
		worklib.basic_ram:sv <0x4118a87d>
			streams:   1, words:  2263
		worklib.basic_ram_tb:sv <0x0a0c00bf>
			streams:  11, words: 10602
 wire [3:0]mem[3:0][3:0];
             |
ncelab: *W,COVMDD (./basic_ram_tb.sv,6|13): Toggle coverage for bit, logic, reg, wire, and struct multi-dimensional static arrays and vectors is not supported by default. To enable toggle coverage on for these types specify 'set_toggle_scoring -sv_mda [<max_bit_base2_exponent>] [-sv_mda_of_struct]' ccf command in the coverage configuration file.
	Building instance specific data structures.
	Loading native compiled code:     .................... Done
