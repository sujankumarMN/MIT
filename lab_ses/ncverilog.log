		Caching library 'worklib' ....... Done
	Elaborating the design hierarchy:
	counterr dut1(cont_int);

ncelab: *W,CUINFN (./counter_tb.sv,12|22): A named interface port should be connected to an interface of the same name (counter_tb).
ncelab: *W,DSEMEL: This SystemVerilog design will be simulated as per IEEE 1800-2009 SystemVerilog simulation semantics. Use -disable_sem2009 option for turning off SV 2009 simulation semantics.

	Extracting FSMs for coverage:
		worklib.counterr
		worklib.counter_tb
	Total FSMs extracted = 0
	Building instance overlay tables: .................... Done
	Enabling instrumentation for coverage types: block expression FSM toggle functional
ncelab: *W,COVDCL: By default expression coverage is scored only for Verilog logical operators (|| and &&) and VHDL logical operators (OR, AND, NOR, and NAND), and is scored only in condition expressions. To score coverage for other operators and for expressions in other statements, use the "set_expr_coverable_operators" and "set_expr_coverable_statements" coverage configuration file commands with suitable options at elaboration.

	Loading native compiled code:     .................... Done

ncsim: *W,DSEM2009: This SystemVerilog design is simulated as per IEEE 1800-2009 SystemVerilog simulation semantics. Use -disable_sem2009 option for turning off SV 2009 simulation semantics.
